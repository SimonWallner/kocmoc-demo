# timecode in seconds, based on the animation time base
# this timebase usually starts at 0
# blank lines are ignored, comments are prefixed with '#'
# negative times can be usefull for start conditions for catmull-rom interpol.
# linear inerpolation is used for scalar values, catmul-rom is used for vectors
# Tokens are tab+ separated.

# to make a smooth fado in/out to black one has to use a courve  of roughtly ^1/foo
